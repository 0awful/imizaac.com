      This would be a brief description. It has some words. Importantly it does
      not have that many words
    </p>
    <div>
      Right here we would have an image file. This is important for creating a
      nice look
    </div>
    <code>Some link to the code</code>
    <p> some link to the literal project </p>
    <p> some link to the writeUP</p>
